Description
Learn how to make a modern Android App with this new course on Android development in Kotlin.

Most tutorials and how to's on Udemy show you the basics of app building, but they don't show you how to use the latest technologies and libraries.

Most projects and jobs require you to know how to use the latest libraries. This is what this course is all about.

The purpose of this course is to give you a practical example of how to use these technologies, all while building a simple example app.



We will learn about:

MVVM architecture using the Google recommended Android Lifecycle Extensions

Dagger2 for dependency injection

RxJava as a reactive framework

Retrofit and JSON for remote server communication

Glide for seamless image loading

Unit tests to test the application and make it stable and robust

And we will build everything in Kotlin, the shiny new language that Google recommends

If you want to get that job as an Android Developer, you need to know how to use these technologies.
